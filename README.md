# Azure Cosmos DB Query Demo

This application shows improvements to the Azure Cosmos DB query engine from this [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/introducing-a-new-system-function-and-optimized-query-operators/).

> NOTE: It is no longer possible to create accounts without the improvements.

## Setup

Edit the `appsettings.json` file and run the application in Visual Studio with `CTRL + F5` or with the command line with `dotnet run`.
